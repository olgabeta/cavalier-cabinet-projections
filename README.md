# Cavalier-Cabiner Projections project in COMPUTER GRAPHICS uni course

For this project, we were asked to calculate the edge lengths of the oblique Cavalier and Cabinet projections of a unit cube projected in the xâˆ’y plane using an azimuth angle, and build a program to interactively rotate the cube and print the perspective Cavalier and Cabinet projections in different windows.

The report was written using Overleaf/LaTeX.
